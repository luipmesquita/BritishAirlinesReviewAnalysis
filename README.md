This project aimed to analyse an uncleaned database "British Airlines Reviews" available at Kaggle.

On folder "01_data_files", it can be found the raw dataset and the processed files. The raw dataset was uncleaned and with the use of python, it was cleaned. The script that processed the raw data is in "02_scripts".

The final step was to make some visualization of the data with the use of Tableau Public. In "03_views", it can be found a text file with my Tableau Public Profile where the viz is published. Also the Tableau file is available for download if you wish to see my work on desktop app.
